# Faster Factory

_Make FactoryBot factories go faster_

`FasterFactory` finds `FactoryBot` factories and replaces them with faster methods.
It prefers `FactoryBot.build_stubbed` over `FactoryBot.build` over `FactoryBot.create`.
It doesn't change your tests in any other way.
It changes one occurrence at a time, then runs the localized test for that change.
If the tests pass, it commits the change.
If they fails, it reverts the change.

Largely inspired by [factory_faster](https://github.com/livingsocial/factory_faster) by [Tom Copeland](https://github.com/tcopeland).
